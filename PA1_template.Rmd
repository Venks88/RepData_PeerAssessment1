This is an R Markdown document. This markdown file contains all the parts for assignment 1, and it holds the code and needed diagrams for completion of the assignment.


```{r}
##setting the working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Venkata/Downloads/repdata_data_activity")
```



```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", 
                      colClasses = c("numeric", "character","numeric"))
str(activity)
```

From the summary of the dataset we can see that the column containing the dates is not properly formatted to a Date class so we will adjust that now.

```{r}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
str(activity)
```

We can also note that there are some missing values in the column of the steps.

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

***QUESTION 1: What is mean total number of steps taken per day?***

There are totoal of 2304 missing values, that will be excluded temporarily.

The dataset called "activity_rm" is created for this reason.


```{r}
activity_rm<-activity[which(!is.na(activity$steps)),]
```

The number of steps taken is measured in timeslots, 5-minute intervals, so in order to compute the total number of steps taken for each day we will aggregate the data by day.

```{r}
perday<-tapply(activity_rm$steps, activity_rm$date, sum)
```

So, now the per day dataset contains the total number of steps taken for each day of October and November (total 53 days)
Let's make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

***Plot of chunk histogram1***

```{r}
hist(perday,10, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "", col = "red")
```



***The mean total number of steps during a whole day is 1.0766 × 104, while the median of the total steps is 10765.***

```{r}
mean(perday)
```

```{r}
median(perday)
```

***QUESTION 2: What is the average daily activity pattern?***

In order to explore our data throughout the day, we will need to aggregate the dataset by the intervals. A per interval array is created for this reason and a time series plot will also be created.

Please keep in mind that the x-axis point labels are the names of the intervals in the dataset. The coding of the interval names is such, so that e.g. 500 should be conidered as 5:00 and 1000 as 10:00, ans so on. So, one can consider th x-axis as a fuull 24-hour-day starting from midnight and ending at the next midnight hour.

***Plot of chunk daily average activity***

```{r}
dailyact<-tapply(activity_rm$steps, activity_rm$interval, mean)
plot(y = dailyact, x = names(dailyact), type = "l", xlab = "5-Minute-Interval", 
    main = "Daily Activity Pattern", ylab = "Average number of steps", col = "green")
```


***Finally, we find out that the interval with the maximum average number of steps throughout the days is 835 with 206.1698 steps.***

```{r}
dailyact[dailyact==max(dailyact)]
```

***QUESTION 3: Inputing missing values***

As discussed earlier in this report, there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations of the data.


```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))

sum(is.na(activity))
```

The count of missing values for the column of steps equals to the total number missing in the whole dataset, so we can be sure that the intervals and the dates do not have any.

**So, 2304 missing values is a percentage of 13.11% on the total observations, so obviously there will be some bias.**

In order to exclude the bias we have to come up with a method for filling all of the missing values in the dataset. Some quick ways are to use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for a 5-minute interval, etc.

We will go with the option of using the mean of the 5-minute interval, and thus we will now reate a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
act_new <- activity
act_new[which(is.na(act_new$steps)),1]<-
        dailyact[as.character(act_new[which(is.na(act_new$steps)),3])]
```

Now missing values are now in the new dataset:

```{r}
sum(is.na(act_new))
```

Now let's make the same histogram, that we made in the first part of the analysis, in order to visually see if there is a big effect.

***Plot of chunk histogram both***

```{r}
perday_new<-tapply(act_new$steps, act_new$date, sum)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(perday,10, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Steps"
     , ylim =c(0, 25))
abline(v = median(perday), col = 4, lwd = 4)
hist(perday_new,10, main = "Total number of steps taken per day  
     (missing values replaced with mean of interval)", xlab = "Steps",
     ylim =c(0, 25))
abline(v = median(perday_new), col = 4, lwd = 4)

```

We now calculate the median and the mean of the filled in dataset.

```{r}
mean(perday_new)


median(perday_new)
```

The impact of inputting missing data is minimal, as only the median seems to be changing but by just over one step.

```{r}
mean(perday_new)-mean(perday)


median(perday_new)-median(perday)
```

***QUESTION 4: Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?***

In this part of the assigment, we will create factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
act_new$wd<-weekdays(act_new$date)
act_new$fwd<- as.factor(c("weekend", "weekday"))
act_new[act_new$wd == "Sunday" | act_new$wd == "Saturday" ,5]<- factor("weekend")
act_new[!(act_new$wd == "Sunday" | act_new$wd == "Saturday"),5 ]<- factor("weekday")
```

Now we will create two aggregated arrays for the total number of steps taken per 5-minute time interval for weekdays and weekends, and make a graph in order to compare it there is a difference.

Note that the plot has been created in the base system.

***plot of chunk daily average activity per fwd***

```{r}
act_new_we <- subset(act_new, fwd == "weekend") 
act_new_wd <- subset(act_new, fwd == "weekday") 
dailyact_we<-tapply(act_new_we$steps, act_new_we$interval, mean)
dailyact_wd<-tapply(act_new_wd$steps, act_new_wd$interval, mean)
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(y = dailyact_wd, x = names(dailyact_wd), type = "l", xlab = "5-Minute Interval", 
     main = "Daily Activity Pattern on Weekdays", ylab = "Average number of steps", 
     ylim =c(0, 250), col = "red")
plot(y = dailyact_we, x = names(dailyact_we), type = "l", xlab = "5-Minute Interval", 
     main = "Daily Activity Pattern on Weekends", ylab = "Average number of steps", 
     ylim =c(0, 250), col ="red")
```


***From the two graphs, we can clearly see that the distribution throughout the day is quite different. First of all, the individual from whom the measurements were taken, seems to wake up at least one hour later at the weekends.***

Another interesting finding is that there is a huge amount of steps taken on weekdays, possibly while going to work or working out, which does not appear on Saturdays or Sundays. 

Generally, the whole weekend seems to be more evenly distributed with no huge deviations during hours when a normal person is expected to be awake and active. But, we can observe on average more steps during a weekend day, than on a "working" day. 

***So, this individual is currently employed (or a volunteer), he/she does not take the car to and from work. As far as his/her job is concerned, he/she is not a teacher (as my teacher wife claims) or a waiter.***
